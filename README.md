# dataExplorers
website-based tools for exploring public data. Probably written in php.

These were originally written for the eeps data zoo, and that's probably where they will remain. 

Users can choose what attributes to get and, in a limited way, which cases. 

* nhanes: 2003 data, about 20,000 cases. (You can filter by age)
* acs: 2013, California sample of the ACS data.
